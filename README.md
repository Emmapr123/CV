## Emma Priester

I am an energetic and creative front-end developer, recently graduated from a full stack software development Bootcamp at Makers Academy, on my way to what I can only imagine to be an amazing time with a career in software development.

Before I started coding I did a degree in Fine art, with focus on Sculpture, that was inspired by my love for physics and science, combined with a desire to create. whilst looking around for more, exciting ways to combine these passions I came across the wonderful world of coding, which is ultimately why I am here, in my London living room, writing my CV for you to read right now!

I love that development on the one hand merely requires a functioning brain and a working laptop, whilst on the other hand is often built upon working on projects within a team. That makes for both a flexible life, and wonderful teamwork!

## Experience

**Independent artist** (2018 to present)  

- Working as an independent artist I spent most of my days working with fellow artists on projects. This meant that I was not just welding all day every day, I also spent loads of time editing audio and video, which to my surprise involved quite some JacaScript (which is the language that Adobe was writen in), and designing online awareness for exhibitions!

**By Weekly, art gallery** (2017 to 2019)  
_Initiator_

- When I was in art school I realised that the town in which I lived did not offer a lot of exhibition spaces and opportunities for young artists. I figured just being sad about it wouldn't get us anywhere, and decided to take matters into my own hands. I set up my own gallery that ran for a few years, opening a new exhibition every other week. This allowed amazing experiences of working with artists in al mediums, working on the marketing side of the art world, and I even wrote a research paper on artist-run initiatives that was published in a Dutch art research magazine!

## Skills

#### Teammate!

- I absolutely adore working in a team! Working on projects together, giving creative input, and helping each other out when anybody gets stuck.
- As the saying goes: a team is only as strong as its weakest link, this does not mean to get rid of the weakest link, that means you get to push each other to your best potential within a team!
- I have been an avid hockey player since I was seven years old. Even making it to the under 16s mid regional team in the Netherlands when I was 14. At that time my entire life revolved around the teamwork, I can't wait to find an other team to be part of!

#### Attention for detail

- Working as an artist, detail is one of the most important skills to train. This started with patiently learning to weld, and for the past few months has become more evident in other media through editing audio and video:

#### Project starter

- Whenever I have a spare moment of time I like to initiate projects or get something productive started, weither it is a blog, gallery, or a social event for the team, I am keen to organise it!

#### Creative

- I can imagine you were already waiting for this one. With 'artist' on the top of my CV I can't possibly leave it out. Being trained in a less traditionally scientific way, but rather in a problem solving - building original stuff kind of way, I tend to have a different approach to problems than other people, out of the box solutions could just make for some quality code!
